# FrauDB

FrauDB is a free and open public service which maintains an anonymous database of users associated with acts of abusive activity, fraud and e.t.c. This is achieved by cryptographically hashing the identifying information of users who are flagged and storing the resulting hash in the database. The database can then be searched by hashing any piece of identifying information one would like to check and querying for the resulting hash in the database, e.g. the email address example@example.com.
